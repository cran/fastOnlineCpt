Description: Implementation of a simple algorithm designed for online multivariate changepoint detection of a mean in sparse changepoint settings. The algorithm is based on a modified cusum statistic and guarantees control of the type I error on any false discoveries, while featuring O(1) time and O(1) memory updates per series as well as a proven detection delay.
